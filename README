Install instructions (Linux)
==============================


You will need the following development libraries installed: Qt4, FFTW,
Hamlib, and PortAudio.

Various development packages include g++, Git, and pkg-config. 

1. Clone Tor's repository to your local machine (read only):

    $ git clone git://github.com/n4ogw/so2sdr.git

or, from your account on Git Hub create your own fork of Tor's repository and
clone a read/write repository to your local machine.

2. By default, so2sdr will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and associated
data files will be placed in /usr/local/share/so2sdr. If you want to
change the location of the program, edit SO2SDR_INSTALL_DIR in so2sdr/so2dr.pro.

3. cd so2sdr

4. qmake

5. make

6. (as superuser) make install

7. Test and contribute!

Building under Windows (Linux cross-compile)
==============================================

The Windows version can be compiled inside the MXE cross-development
environment (http://mxe.cc). The install file is generated with NSIS
(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System),
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page. The full procedure is described
in the file so2sdr-windows-notes.txt.
