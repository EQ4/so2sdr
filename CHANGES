Version 1.4.2
------------------------------------------------
New Features:

Update cty and supercheck partial files.

Version 1.4.1
------------------------------------------------
New features:

Callsign history

 To enable: define history file ("history.dat" or similar)
in Contest Options dialog. If this file does not exist, it 
will be created in the user's configuration directory. This
file is a SQLite database and can be edited with any 
SQLite tool.

 If "Call History" is checked in Contest Options, 
exchange fields for the current contest will be filled
in from the history file. Stored fields include
General, Domenstic Mult, Name, State, ARRL Section,
Grid, and Number. If different contests share the
same type of exchange field, different history
files must be used.

 If "Append Call History" is checked, exchanges from
stations worked will be added during the contest.

 The history can also be updated from a loaded log using
"Update History from Log" in the File menu. This can be
used to build up a history file from old logs.



Bug fixes:

- The frequency range covered by the bandmap is now
shown in the bandmap title bar. When finding a clear 
frequency (BEST_CQ), if the frequency range chosen in the bandmap
options is outside the range actually covered, the upper
or lower limits will be adjusted.
- Fixed bug in CQWW scoring.
- Fixed rate display again.
- Bug fixes with AutoCQ.
- Fix crashing bug in Cabrillo import.
- Improved Alt-D: mult/needed QSO information
remains visible on second radio.
- Fix segfault when exiting program without loading contest.

Version 1.2.1 05/12/12
-------------------------------------------------
- Can now log qso's on non-contest and VHF/UHF bands. These
will not show in the band breakdown however.
- More accurate bearings and sunrise/set times. If the stations'
zone is given in wl_cty.dat, the zone is used to estimate latitude
and longitude rather than the default entry for that country.
Depending on where the station is located in the zone and whether
CQ or ITU zones are bring used, the accuracy in the location will
vary. Note that entering your own call now gives your exact sunrise
and sunset (determined from your grid square).
- Fixed bug with sunrise/set and polar stations.

Version 1.2.0
--------------------------------------------------
 Major internal changes to log. Log (".log" file) is now
stored using SQLITE database:

- Logs from older versions are not compatable: if you need to
open an older log, convert it to cabrillo first and then use 
"import cabrillo"
- Log is now editable during the contest. Time, callsign, and
exchange fields may be edited by clicking/double clicking on the
appropriate field; Enter accepts changes and pressing Escape reverts
them.
- QSO's can not be deleted once entered. However, unchecking the
check box on a qso will remove it from the scoring and cabrillo output.
- After a log edit the log is re-duped and the multiplier total and score
 is recalculated.
- To search for a call in the log enter a call (or partial call)
in the callsign window and press "ctrl-F". Search results that appear
can then be edited as above.

- Bandmap spots are saved to disk (file ".dat") when exiting
the program.
- Other bug fixes

Version 1.1.11 08/21/2011
--------------------------------------------------
- Fix problems with Windows build
- Check to create user directory before checking hamlib backends
- Updates to some default contests config files
- change escape behavior during alt-D

Version 1.1.10 08/02/2011
--------------------------------------------------
-Fix (I think) bug causing crash when rig keyed with paddle
and only 1 bandmap active

Version 1.1.9 07/22/2011
--------------------------------------------------
-new feature in bandmap: dragging on frequency label field will
move the central frequency


Version 1.1.8 07/16/2011
--------------------------------------------------
-switch to Portaudio callback API. DSound API (and maybe others)
should now work in Windows
-each audio device marked with a check if it supports the
required sample rate and format
-simplify Portaudio error message popup windows
-show ASIO control panel if an ASIO device is selected
-{CLEAR_RIT} works at least with Elecraft radios


Version 1.1.6 07/06/2011
--------------------------------------------------
-update CTY and MASTER.DTA files
-add highlighting of bands in use in breakdown area
-fix issues with exchange prefill
-fix bugs in IARU contest

Version 1.1.3 05/28/2011
--------------------------------------------------
More bug fixes:
     -"TX" signal to bandmaps is per-radio
     -";" for 2nd radio qsy was broken when frequency 21xxx
     -click-qsy feature fixed
     -saving of bandmap window position sometimes failed
     -SWAP_RADIOS was broken
     -newer versions of g++ complained with some of my C++ syntax and
     the way I called constructors

Discovered issue with hamlib and RIT clear: there is no way in hamlib
to clear the RIT without turning it off altogether. So I don't recommend
using the {CLEAR_RIT} macro. If you are compiling hamlib, it is possible
to patch this behavior, I will post a fix at least for Elecraft.

Version 1.1.2 05/20/2011
--------------------------------------------------
Many bug fixes

Removed average background subtraction- it did not work
in practice.

Version 1.1.1 04/12/2011
--------------------------------------------------
Adds capability to subtract an averaged background from the
spectrum. This can be used for example to remove spurs generated in
the sound card. To use, disconnect antenna, then select "Set background".
The spectrum will be averaged for a few seconds and saved.

bug fixes:
-initialization of IQ correction 


Version 1.1.0 04/05/2011
--------------------------------------------------
major code changes:

-use Hamlib for radio communications
-parallel port control now using PPDEV kernel module in linux
 rather than direct port access. Program no longer setuid
-major changes to multi-threading code

Version 1.0.1  01/16/2011
--------------------------------------------------

Some text entry fields now are automatically uppercase
(callsign, CW messages, ...).

When clicking in the call or exchange entry fields, change
to the appropriate radio.


Version 1.0.0   12/27/2010
--------------------------------------------------

Supported hardware:

Radios:

    Elecraft K2
    Elecraft K3

SDR bandscope:

    I/Q soundcard based (Softrock, LP-PAN, etc)


Miscellaneous:

     Winkey
     headphone, radio switching: parallel port

Issues and limitations:



 log is not editable; make a note (Ctrl+N) if a qso is logged
 incorrectly and fix it in the cabrillo

 After opening a contest config file, you must exit and
 restart so2sdr before opening another contest 

 bandmap entries are not saved when quitting the program

 key click filter is not very effective

 Linux: the program is setuid root to enable parallel port
 access. Root access is dropped after the parallel port is opened,
 so the port choice can't be changed later.

 Windows: only MME soundcard API is working
 
 Some issues with keyboard focus when opening menus; may need to 
 disable keyboard grab when changing cw messages or other settings

 support for SSB is limited

 sunrise/sunset times shown are computed from the latitude
 and longitude listed in wl_cty.dat. They are not very accurate for
 large countries.

 no multi-operator support

 external packetclusters can be connected to; due to the limited
 frequency resolution in packetcluster spots and frequency errors, 
 this does not work very well for highlighting stations on the bandmap

 probably lots of bugs...
